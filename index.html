            <p>Against the backdrop of a contentious Presidential election season, hundreds of bills targeting trans people, and efforts to strip discussions of race and sexuality from schools across the country, 200 pastors, Christian leaders and academics gathered in a room one April afternoon in Raleigh, North Carolina.

</p>

            <p>Pastors from New York City, Colorado and Texas talked with church leaders from Philadelphia, Denmark and Wisconsin all gathered in the lobby of Church on Morgan to discuss what led them to re-examine their faith, walk away from the church and seek out a conference like this. Some expressed fears that their home church would find out that they attended the conference, and remove them from leadership roles.

</p>

            <p>Over the years, the church has lost its shine amongst many Americans. Its failure to respond to the unjust treatment of Black people, the handling of abuse cases by leaders and the homophobia exhibited throughout the institution is driving people – many of them young – away from religion altogether.  Recent <a href= 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/'>Pew Research </a> has predicted that if current trends continue, only about half of Americans will identify as Christians in a few decades, the first time that’s happened since data’s been collected on the subject. That same data also shows a rise in religious “nones,” people who describe themselves as atheist, agnostic or without any particular spiritual beliefs.

</p>

            <p>A growing number of people — like the pastors in Raleigh — have turned their backs on the institution, but not from their faith. The question that this community of people is trying to answer, then, is if they can ever be separated from one another. 

</p>

            <p>The conference also brought people from a host of different denominations within the Christian faith, including Lutherans, Protestants and Baptists. No matter where they came from, they all came together under one label: “post-evangelical.” 
</p>

            <p>“I’m assuming we’re all here because we feel homeless in the larger church landscape,” said Mike Goldsworthy, the gathering’s first speaker. 
</p>

            <p>Goldsworthy is one of the founding members of the conference’s host organization, the Post-Evangelical Collective, a decentralized network of pastors and faith leaders looking to cultivate a more inclusive and justice-oriented display of the Christian faith than the one they grew up in or, for some, led.
            </p>
            <p class="aside_sidebar">"What I see and hear with a lot of people with the Post-Evangelical Collective is a sense that we’re building something that’s going somewhere.”</p>
            
            <p>As Goldsworthy talked about the feeling of loneliness he felt when he decided to walk away from the organized Evangelical church, people in the room nodded affirmingly. 
</p>

            <p>While this group in the room came from vastly different backgrounds, everyone was seeking to build something out of the rubble that comes from deconstruction – a term used to describe the phenomenon of people breaking down their religion and rethinking what parts they want to keep and throw away.
</p>

            <p>One of the gathering’s attendees was Michael Hidalgo. Hidalgo has led Denver Community Church in Colorado for almost 20 years. After his church moved toward becoming fully affirming – meaning that the church believes in the full inclusion of members of the LGBTQ+ people in the congregation and church leadership – they received significant backlash. 
</p>
            <p> For many Christians, this sort of backlash leads to a process of deconstruction, oftentimes with no end in sight. 
            </p>
            <p>“If all you’re doing for 20-plus years is deconstructing, you almost have nothing left,” Hidalgo said. “But what I see and hear with a lot of people with the Post-Evangelical Collective is a sense that we’re building something that’s going somewhere.”

            <h2> Trump's Impact on the Church</h2>
            <p>One of the most high-profile people in the room was Brian Recker, a 36-year-old Evangelical Pastor-turned-deconstruction coach and a social media influencer, since walking away from the Evangelical church four years ago. 
</p>

            <p>Recker grew up in a strict Fundamentalist household before attending Bob Jones University, a Christian university that <a href= "https://www.thereap.org/post/bob-jones-university-a-history-of-discrimination"> wasn’t integrated</a> until 1979 and didn’t allow interracial dating until 2000. After graduating from Bob Jones, Recker joined the Marine Corps and settled in the small coastal town of Beaufort, N.C. He became a pastor of a multi-site Evangelical church, married his college crush and had children. </p>

            <p>Recker saw Evangelicalism, a movement focused on more charismatic and contemporary practices, as a welcomed change from the strict traditional values associated with Fundamentalism. 
</p>

            <p>Recker’s seemingly perfect life, and his perfect faith, started to fall apart in 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President. 
</p>

            <p>“Before then, politics wasn’t really on my mind. Things like LGBT+ issues were so far from what I thought of as accessible, having been raised in Fundamentalism,” he said. “It wasn’t even on my radar to consider the injustice of my position.”
            </p>
            <p class="aside_sidebar"> “Even though the other pastors believed that racism was wrong and stuff, we were told that if we said things like that while preaching, people would just leave and find another church that affirmed their beliefs" </p> 
            
            <p> Recker watched as his dad, who had scolded him about the dangers of treating sex casually, excused Trump’s Access Hollywood tape as “normal locker room talk.” 
            </p>

            <p> He watched church leadership tell pastors not to speak on social issues or politics at the pulpit. 
            </p>

            <p> “Even though the other pastors believed that racism was wrong and stuff, we were told that if we said things like that while preaching, people would just leave and find another church that affirmed their beliefs,” Recker said. “It’s not in your best interests financially to question things.”
            </p>

            <p> Trump’s election can be credited in no <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/'> small</a> part, to the Evangelical church, and that realization caused major rifts in Recker’s, and many of the gathering’s other attendees, perceptions of the church. 
            </p>

            <p>Many people at the gathering expressed that their congregation’s unconditional embrace of Donald Trump, after the way he talked about immigrants, women and LGBTQ+ people caused them, for the first time, to earnestly question the institution they’d given the majority of their lives to. 
            </p>

            <p> David Campbell, an author and Director of the Notre Dame Democracy Initiative, doesn’t think what’s happened to many people at the gathering is isolated. Campbell discovered that, increasingly, people have begun abandoning religion because their churches  no longer aligned with their political beliefs. </p>

            <p> “People will prioritize their politics over religion,” Campbell said. The reason, he said, is because of a sort of “cognitive dissonance” that occurs. “If you are a progressive, or just not someone who thinks of yourself as terribly conservative and you think of religion, you think of it as closely wedded to the Religious Right.” What this means, is that people decide that they don’t want to identify as religious.</p>

            <p>Campbell’s research found that this has become much more pronounced in recent years, not because more people in the church are speaking up about politics, but because politicians – largely on the Right – have begun “mixing with religion,” in a way that is “partisan in nature.”</p>

            <h2>Politicization of the church</h2>

            <p> Kristin Du Mez has spent years studying the Evangelical church, from its embrace of militant masculinity to its shift toward conservatism. </p>

            <p> The allure Recker felt toward Evangelicalism juxtaposed with his Fundamentalist upbringing is not only common, but by design, she said. Prior to the 1940s, there were a variety of people who called themselves “Evangelicals.” </p>

            <p> According to Du Mez, whose book <em>Jesus & John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured A Nation</em> chronicles the history of the modern Evangelical movement and its shifts to the right, there were evangelical feminists, evangelical abolitionists and evangelicals who supported the racist status quo. </p>

            <p> That changed in the 1940s when the modern Evangelical movement began to take shape. </p>

            <p> This was in conjunction with the founding of the National Association of Evangelicals. </p>

            <p> “They were essentially just rebranding Fundamentalism.” Even though the doctrine was practically the same, some Fundamentalists didn’t agree with the rebrand and kept the Fundamentalist label. </p>

            <p> According to Du Mez, This has led to people “erroneously overemphasizing the separation between evangelicals and fundamentalists,.” Du Mez said. After the rebrand, even though the church’s politics were still largely conservative, there was a minority faction of progressive evangelicals. </p>

            <p> This all changed in the 1980s, when there was a “conservative takeover,” Du Mez called it. “There was this wedding of evangelical politics with conservative republicanism, and that leads us into the Christian right that we know today.” </p>

            <p> While there still is a minority faction of more progressive evangelicals, the power has remained on the conservative side of the political aisle ever since. </p>
            
            <p class='aside_sidebar'> In many evangelical churches, the people you sit next to on Sunday are also the people you go to lunch with afterward, you call to watch your kids or who talk you through tough points in your marriage.</p>

            <p> Du Mez recalled speaking to many people in speaking engagements and talks where people tell her of their fear of leaving the conservative evangelical church due to the same consequences that Recker faced. </p>

            <p> “It takes a while for people to leave because they’re often socially embedded and emotionally connected to these institutions, making leaving really painful,” Du Mez said. </p>

            <p> In many evangelical churches, the people you sit next to on Sunday are also the people you go to lunch with afterward, you call to watch your kids or who talk you through tough points in your marriage. Sometimes, in Recker’s case, it’s also the thing that puts food on the table. </p>

            <p> Despite these difficulties, people throughout all parts of the evangelical infrastructure have done an about-face. </p>

            <p> In 2019, pastor Josh Harris, who wrote the popular – and controversial – book <em> I Kissed Dating Goodbye </em> in 1997, announced that he was discontinuing the sale of his book and had given up his Christian faith. In 2022, American pastor Mike Maeshiro walked away from his church, and has since come out as gay. </p>

            <h2> Rise of The Post-Evangelical Collective </h2>

            <p> Keri Ladouceur is a pastor and one of the founders of the Post-Evangelical Collective, a group of pastors and Christians who find themselves removed from the mainstream Church and embracing progressive social causes. </p>

            <p> In order to become a member of the Collective, a church must commit to only <a href="https://www.postevangelicalcollective.org/the-invitation"> five pillars </a>: </p>

            <!-- unordered list -->
            <ul>
              <li>A commitment to the way of Jesus </li>
              <li>Full inclusion of everyone, regardless of race, sexuality or gender expression</li> 
              <li>The pursuit of liberation “in ourselves, church communities cities, and the world”</li> 
              <li>Diversity of scriptures</li> 
              <li>A desire to lead with grace.</li>
            </ul> 

            <p>At the North Carolina gathering, Ladouceur spoke about the abnormality of the group’s decision to not include strict doctrinal requirements in order to be a part of the denomination. </p>

            <p>This is a far cry from organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Baptist organization in the world, which requires affiliate churches to submit to various statements they view as biblically rooted. </p>

            <p> According to their <a href="https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/">Baptist Faith and Message </a>, “While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor/elder/overseer is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.” The Faith and Message statement also requires that Christians oppose all forms of “sexual immorality,” including homosexuality. </p>

            <p> When the Collective started, Ladouceur hoped it would be a space for pastors who were “doing something a little different than the predominant Evangelical model,” she said. They’d planned for a small meeting of 20 or so people back in 2021. Over 100 people showed up. Since that first meeting, they’ve hosted 15 meetings across the country, and this North Carolina convening is their second, and largest, gathering.</p>

            <p> Ladouceur remembers the 2021 convening being “full of hope.” She recalls one of the sessions, where everyone sat together on stools – a far cry from the strict hierarchy and pageantry of typical organized Christian spaces. </p>

            <p>“People were telling stories of how they lost their ordination or how their denomination kicked them out because they became affirming of queer people or the cost they paid for speaking up about racism in their city,” she said, adding that people felt validated in their journey. “This is growing into a community of people who’ve deconstructed but that didn’t land in a cynical, ex-Evangelical place.” </p>

            <h2> The upcoming election </h2>

            <p> Since the late 1900s, the Evangelical church has spent time, money and resources to speak out against abortion – the exact timing of the resurgence of the anti-choice Church is still <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/05/16/what-everyone-gets-wrong-about-evangelicals-abortion/">contested </a>. This came to a head when, in 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade, to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2022/05/04/faith-leaders-react-scotus-leak-abortion/"> celebration </a> of Evangelicals all across the country. Recently, the church has also mobilized to fight the teaching of so-called “critical race theory” and “gender ideology” in schools. </p>

            <p> After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, the Evangelical Right has asserted its dominance in various forms and they show no signs of slowing down. </p>


            <p> There’s a strong presence of Christian pastors and faith leaders in the effort to get Trump reelected in the 2024 election. Major Christian figures such as Lance Wallnau and Mario Murillo have even launched tours in major battleground states to get potential Republican Christian voters out to the polls as the election looms closer. </p>

            <p class='aside_sidebar'> "This election is going to really see a bumping up against the religious right by such strong progressive Christian voices. Because so much is at stake."</p>

            <p>Many people in the post-evangelical space express a nervousness around the church’s role in the next election, and what it could mean for them. “If Trump is elected, many faith communities committed to justice are gonna have to do a lot of thinking about what real resistance looks like,” Michael Hidalgo said. “I don’t think we can just ask how we can care for oppressed people more, but I think we have to ask the question ‘what does resistance look like?’”

            <p>Churches across the country have begun asserting their power to champion progressive causes in ways not seen in recent years. Rev Serene Jones, President of Union Theological Seminary, has kept an eye on the Religious Left throughout the years, and she sees something fundamentally different about their resurgence this time around.</p>

            <p>“In the South in particular, you see churches coming together and committing themselves to the political process,” Jones said, citing the 2021 election of Senator Raphael Warnock and the growing popularity of poll chaplains – faith leaders who sit at various polling stations and ensure that vulnerable populations are treated equitably at the ballot.</p> 

            <p> She sees the upcoming election as a crucial one for this country, and for the church. </p>

            <p>“From what I’m hearing and feeling, this election is going to really see a bumping up against the religious right by such strong progressive Christian voices. Because so much is at stake,” she said.</p> 

            <p>Brian Recker is a bit less confident in the organizational potential of the Christian Left to rival that of the right, but with a massive following of people tuning in to hear his words, he recognizes his responsibility to use his platform as best as he can. </p>

            <p>In January, Recker hosted an Instagram livestream with Democratic presidential candidate Marriene Williamson, a progressive faith leader. In it, they discussed the place of spirituality in politics, and their hopes for the future of both the country and the church.</p>

            <p>Dr. Angela Parker, an assistant professor of New Testament and Greek, and one of the few Black people at the Post-Evangelical Collective’s gathering, felt encouraged by the turnout and the conversations she heard at the gathering, especially in the wake of the election.</p>

            <p>“This is a group of people who are reconsidering what it means to be different white Christians,” she said.</p> 

            <p>For Parker, many of the spaces she speaks in are mostly white. That has given her a unique perspective into this movement’s potential.</p> 

            <p>“The loudest white evangelical voices tend to be on the far Right, and they tend to have the larger platforms,” she said. Despite the potential for the Right to drown out more progressive voices, Parker believes that spaces like this can have an impact.</p> 

            <p>“These folks still have connections to their family members who are on the far Right, so hopefully their conversations with them can bring about incremental change.”</p> 

            <p>According to Parker, if Trump is not elected in the upcoming election, “these Christians can be a resource for far right christians to begin to think differently about their Christianity.” On the other side of that, “this will be an underground militant group that will have to constantly be fighting the political battle. And the way I see it, they have to be on the front lines for trans people, for Black people…They have to literally put their bodies on the line.”</p>

            <h2>Moving Forward </h2> 

            <p>At the end of the gathering's final day, the attendees held a “re-frocking” ceremony for church leaders who lost their ordination or had been asked to leave their previous denomination. In church culture, defrocking is the most serious penalty that can be levied onto a faith leader.</p> 

            <p>In recent years, many leaders of the Catholic Church were defrocked after the Vatican church found them guilty of sexual abuse or rape.</p> 

            <p>Roughly 20 people stood up and walked toward the stage. They had each been defrocked because they chose to affirm queer people and their sanctity, believe in a woman’s capability to be a worthy leader of the church or publicly advocate for the rights for people considering abortions to make their own decision.</p> 

            <p>The work of the Collective, and people who believe in its work, has only just begun. Some of the attendees talked about officially registering themselves and their churches as members of the Collective. Others expressed plans to leave their mainstream churches and find a new home with values more aligned.</p>

            <p>Kevin Haah, a San Francisco-based religious scholar and lawyer, was leading the charge. As he called each of the people on stage by name, he asked only one question as every eye in the room filled with tears: “Do you love Jesus?” Each attendee responded affirmingly.</p> 

            <p>“Then go feed his sheep,” Haah said.</p>
